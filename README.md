# reesd-client - Command-line client for Reesd


## TODO

- `hint` mode. Allow each command to take a `--hint` flag or allow to specify a
  `hint` setting in a configuration file. When enabled, that mode makes
  commands output a bit more information to help the user take the next step.
  For instance, when listing available workflows, the `hint` mode would suggest
  to instanciate one.
